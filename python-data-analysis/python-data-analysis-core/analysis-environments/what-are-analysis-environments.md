# What Are Analysis Environments?

---
## Content

When it comes to coding in Python, there are several environments you can choose from.

These environments are shells, [IDE's](https://www.enki.com/glossary/general/ide), and other ways where you can test, run, modify, execute, and so on, a programming language's code.

For instance, the most basic environment you can write Python in is your OS's terminal[1]. 

To open the Python environment in your terminal (known as *initializing the [interpreter](https://www.enki.com/glossary/general/interpreter)*), type in the word `python` and press Enter.

> ðŸ’¡ Different versions of Python will have different keywords to launch the interpreter. The most common ones are `py` and `python`.

Even though most operating systems come with a pre-installed version of the Python interpreter it is not the recommended tool for codinng as it lacks many features.

There are far superior environments with better interpreters for coding in Python, such as
- Jupyter Lab
- IDLE
- nteract
- PyScripter
- Google colab
- VScode
- and many more

> ðŸ’¡ Some of the awesome features these provide are type suggestions, syntax highlighting, in-line graphics, and so on.

In this course, we will be using the Jupyter Lab environment.
