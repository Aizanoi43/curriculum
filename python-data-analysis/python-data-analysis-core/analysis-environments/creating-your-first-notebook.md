# Creating Your First Notebook

---
## Content

Open your terminal and type `jupyter-lab` if yo installed the application locally or go to [their website](https://jupyter.org/try) to open the online version.

Next, to create a new notebook go to `File - > New -> Notebook`.

This will give you an empty notebook with a single empty cell.

At the top, you can choose what kind of cell this will be. There are two types; `Code` and `Text/Markdown` cells.

`Code` is used for any code you want to write and run.

`Text/Markdown` is used for adding text as well as elements like headers, paragraphs, and others.

The first two cells are exactly the same. The first one was executed while the 2nd was not. They are `Text/Markdown` cells.

The third cell is a `Code` cell. The `[1]:` to the left of it means that this was the first `Code` cell that was executed. This cell prints `Hello World` to the console, which is shown underneath it.

The final two cells both have a `[2]:` before them. 

The first `[2]` is shown because that was the second `Code` line that was executed. The next `[2]` is shown because it matches the output of the previous cell. We returned the variable `x` and it resulting output is `"Hello World"`.

> üí° The cell numbers don't have to be in order! If you run the same cell again or run a different cell, the number will increase.

The `Hello World` and `'Hello World'` are outputs from the two code cells.

Next, save the notebook.
