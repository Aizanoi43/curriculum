# Creating Your First Notebook

---
## Content

Open your terminal and type `jupyter-lab` to open the application locally or go to [their website]() to open the online version.

Next, to create a new notebook go to `File - > New -> Notebook`.

This will give you an empty notebook with a single empty cell.

At the top, you can choose what kind of cell this will be. There are two types; `Code` and `Text/Markdown` cells.

`Code` is used for any code you want to write and run.

`Text/Markdown` is used for adding text as well as elements like headers, paragraphs, and others.

The first two cells are exactly the same. The first one was executed while the 2nd was not. They are `Text/Markdown` cells.

The third cell is the first `Code` cell. It was also the first cell of that type that was executed. Shown by `[1]:`.

If you run the same cell again or a different cell, the number will increase. Shown in the second cell;`[2]:`.

The `Hello World` and `'Hello World'` Are outputs from the two code cells.

Next, save the notebook.

> We will be using the same notebook in the next few workouts to import and analyze a dataset.
