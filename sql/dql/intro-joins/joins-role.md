# The Role That Joins Play

---

## Content

When querying a database with multiple tables, retrieving information from several different tables may be necessary.
This is to say, we'd like to combine the columns of some tables based on their relationship.

Say we want to fetch a list of pokemon and their types in the `pokedex` database; however, there is no single table with both the name and the type information. Instead, we have the `pokemon` and `routes` tables. In order to create a list with the desired information, we would have to **join** the tables in some way. **SQL** provides a way for us to do this by using a joining condition between the two tables. For these two tables, the relation is in the `id` columns.

`pokemon`

| id | name       | health | type1    | type2  | base_attack | route |
|----|------------|--------|----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 1  | venusaur   | 53     | grass    | poison | 25          | NULL  |
| 2  | charmeleon | 41     | fire     | NULL   | 16          | 4     |
| 3  | pikachu    | 50     | electric | NULL   | 22          | 4     |
| 4  | squirtle   | 39     | water    | NULL   | 17          | 25    |
| 5  | magikarp   | 25     | water    | NULL   | 12          | 6     |

`routes`

| id | name       |
|----|------------|
| 1  | venusaur   |
| 2  | charmeleon |
| 3  | pikachu    |
| 4  | squirtle   |
| 5  | magikarp   |

To return the `name` and `type1` value of each pokemon, we need to use the `JOIN` keyword. The syntax will be explored in further workouts, but below is the correct query:

```sql
SELECT 
  routes.name,
  pokemon.route
    
FROM pokemon JOIN routes
  ON pokemon.id = routes.id;
```
Notice that the query makes references to both tables and then also states the **joining condition**[1] (`pokemon.id = routes.id`). 
This query returns the following:

| name       | route |
| ---------- | ----- |
| venusaur   | NULL  |
| charmeleon | 4     |
| pikachu    | 4     |
| squirtle   | 25    |
| magikarp   | 6     |

> ðŸ’¡ There are many different types of joins, with different implementations and different results. These are covered in the following few workouts.

## Practice

In order to perform a `JOIN` on two tables, the tables must be ???.

- related
- unrelated
- unstructured

---

## Revision

Fill in the following query in order to have it join `table1` and `table2` on the condition `table1.id_no = table2.id_no`

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1 
??? table2
  ??? table1.id_no = table2.id_no;
```

- JOIN
- ON
- MERGE
- REMAKE
- INTO
- WITH

## Footnotes
[1:Joining Conditions]
A joining condition between two tables is the primary key of one table and the associated foreign key in the other table.
