# Excel File Types 


---

## Content

Before we find out how to import a file, let's see which file types you can import.

These files are commonly created when you save your spreadsheet. They usually start with `.xl` followed by one or two characters. 

The default file type when saving a spreadsheet is `.xlsx`. 

> ðŸ’¡ If you're using a version of Excel that is older than 2007 then the file type would be `.xls`.

If your spreadsheet contains a macro, then it would have the `.xlsm` type.

Templates can have two file types, `.xltx` and `.xltm`. The only difference between the two is that `.xltm` can store macros.

> ðŸ’¡ On Excel versions that are older than 2003, the basic template format is `.xlt`.

If you're using **OpenOffice**, then the default file type is `.ods`.

## Footnotes

[1:Macros]

Macros are miny programs that do not require any code to make. Their goal is to automate repeatable tasks. You go to the Spreadsheet menu, select "Record Macro", and it will start recording your actions. From there, you can create different macros. For example, you can add a custom shortcut and name to each macro. Also, you can schedule macros to execute at specific times. 

Here are just some things you can do with macros:
- Applies different colors at the end of every month to your profit table to easily see the loss/growth of profit.
- Create different formatting options (bold, italic, text color change, and so on)
- Set up a macro to create a specific graph from the selected range of cells
- and so on.
