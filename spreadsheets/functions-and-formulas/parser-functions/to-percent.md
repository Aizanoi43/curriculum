# TO_PERCENT


---

## Content

The `=TO_PERCENT` function is used to convert a number to a percentage.

The syntax is:

```plain-text
=TO_PERCENT(value)
```

The value of `0` corresponds to `0%` and the value of `1` corresponds to `100%`.

> ðŸ’¡ You can use negative numbers to get negative percentages.

```plain-text
=TO_PERCENT(-1)
-100%
```

On the same note, values higher than `1` will result in percentages higher than `100%`:

```plain-text
=TO_PERCENT(13)
1300%
```

Google Sheets doesn't automatically convert values like `0.3` to `30%`. 

You would either need to use this function (`=TO_PERCENT(0.30)`) or use the `Format as percent` menu button. 

You can perform calculations with other functions and enclose them all in `=TO_PERCENT()` to get the result as a percentage.

```plain-text
=TO_PERCENT(
  SUM(13,12,11,11,11)/3000
)
2%
```

In this example, we calculate the `SUM`, divide by `3000`, and lastly convert the result to a percentage.

Here are a few more examples:
