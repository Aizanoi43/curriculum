## Content

Given an empty `dictionary`:
```python
person = {

}
```

And two `list`s:
```python
keys = ['Name', 'Surname', 'Profession']
values = ["Alan", "Turing", "Mathematician"]
```

Can you populate the `person` `dict` using the two `lists`? 

Don't forget to output the new `dictionary`.

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- built-in method (`zip`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.
