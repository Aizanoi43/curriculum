# Python Intro

## Content


Python is the world's fastest-growing programming language.

It's easy to read as the keywords are taken directly from the English Language, and it can be used for just about anything.

For example, the following code check's if you are eligible for a driving license, and if you look closely, you can already understand how it works.

```python
my_age = 20
legal_age = 18
if my_age >= legal_age:
    print("Enjoy the ride!")
else:
    print("Not so fast, kiddo.")
```

Python is used by people of all professions; scientists, analysts, accountants, even kids! 

Some people use it for artificial intelligence, scientific computing, or data analysis, while others use it to create websites and desktop applications. The possibilities are endless!
