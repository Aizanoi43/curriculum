# Iterate Over two Arrays

---

## Content

Given two arrays:

```javascript
let names = ['Stefan', 'Michael', 'Rebekah', "Natasha"];
let lastNames = ['Stojanovic', 'Stevens', 'Mikaelson', "Romanoff"];
```

Can you write a program that will iterate over both arrays simultaneously and output the corresponding values?

Example output:
```plain-text
Stefan Stojanovic
Michael Stevens
....
```

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- flow control (`for...of`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Create the arrays and use a loop to cycle through them. 

> Use the same index to track the second array as well.
