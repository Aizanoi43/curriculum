## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to:
> - **create a `Calculator` class that takes two numbers as input**
> - **add four methods to the class: multiply, divide, subtract and add the two numbers**
> - **call each of the four methods to confirm it works**

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- class creation (`class Something { }`)
- method definition (`something(x) {}`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1].

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

A class in JavaScript is defined like this:

```javascript
class Name {
  method() { /* does stuff */ }
}
```

The name for your class should be `Calculator` and it should have four methods for each arithmetic operation.
