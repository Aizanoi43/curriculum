## Content

> 👩‍💻 Using the `person` object, your tasks are to:
- **add `"German"` to the array of `languages`**
- **replace the `equation` with `"e = mc^2"`**
- **add a new key called `"nobelRecipient"` with the value `true`**
- **delete the `quote` key**
- **log the new `person` object to the console**

Here's how the `person` object looks like:
```javascript
let person = {
  name: "Albert Einstein",
  profession: "Theoretical physicist",
  languages: ["Italian", "English"],
  equation: "c^2 = a^2 + b^2",
  quote: "Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving."
};
```

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- object methods (`.push()`, `delete`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions, and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

[1: Hints]

Use the built-in methods to `delete` the `quote` and to add the new language.
