# Largest Array Element

## Content

Given a numbered `array`:
```python
let numbers = [23, 81, 14, 5, 33, 631, 47, 78, 99]
```

Can you create a loop that will cycle through the `array`, determine which number is the largest, and output it to the console?

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- looping (`for`)
- output (`console.log()`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Assume that the first number is the largest then check if the next number is larger, if it is, update your initial number.
