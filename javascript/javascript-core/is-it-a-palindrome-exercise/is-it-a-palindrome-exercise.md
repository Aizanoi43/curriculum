# Is it a Palindrome?

## Content

Given a palindrome:
```javascript
palindrome = "Was it a car or a cat I saw"
```

Can you create a function that will check if it is or isn't a palindrome?

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- string methods (`.split()`)
- loops (`for`)
- control flow (`if x > 1`)
- function declaration (`function something(x) { ... }`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1].

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Your loop only needs to go up to half the `string` and check if the first value equals the last, second value equals second to last, and so on.
